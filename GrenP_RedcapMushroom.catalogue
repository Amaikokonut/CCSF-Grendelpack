"Red Cap Mushroom"
"A close relative of the lethal Death cap mushroom, however, this species is completely harmless.\n\nOnce in a while, these fungi release cuddly lumps of accumulated spores. These collections contain millions of spores, but are still so light that they can take to the air with the slightest gust of wind. These lumps will also make a nutritious (but not very tasty) snack for any creature."
