# Banshee Ark

This is the Banshee Ark repository.

The Banshee Ark Team wishes you lots of fun with this project!

## How to compile and test for yourself
* Download Jagent here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/jagent/
* Extract Jagent somewhere and open the Monk.jar applet. Make sure to UNTICK the checkbox at "merge files" in the options menu.
* Download this github repository as a .zip file: https://github.com/pareldraakje/CCSF-Grendelpack/archive/master.zip
* Extract it somewhere on disk
* Look for any of the installer cosfiles, which start with "0000_installer_" and have the .cos file extension.
* Drag and drop any of these into your Monk window
* An .agents file will appear in the folder where your cosfile sits. Drag this file into your /agents folder in your Docking Station installation directory.
* Inject the agent via the Agent Injector ingame.
