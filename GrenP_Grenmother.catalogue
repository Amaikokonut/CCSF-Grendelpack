"Grendel Egg Layer"
"What would a ship that's chock-full of Grendels be without a Grendel Egg Layer? This device suits all Grendel Egg Laying needs. Press the yellow arrows to switch from one Grendel Breed to another, then determine your Grendel's gender by pressing the dark buttons below. When the egg is ready to be laid, press the green button. Beware: Grendel eggs hatch quickly compared to those of Norns!\n\nArt by Uzag\nCoding by Pilla"
