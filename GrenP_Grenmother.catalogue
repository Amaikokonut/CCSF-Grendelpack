"Grendel Mother"
"What would a ship that's chock-full of Grendels be without a Grendel Mother? If the amount of Grendels in the universe is low, this machine will try to increase their population by dropping eggs. This is especially useful for those that are willing to welcome new Grendels into their ships, but less handy for those that would rather raise other Creatures."
