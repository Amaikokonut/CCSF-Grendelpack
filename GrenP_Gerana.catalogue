"Gerana"
"These peaceful animals feed on all sorts of detritus, keeping their surrounding tidy and nice. They are rather harmless, but have a few sharp spines upon their back and their bodies are covered with slightly poisonous ooze. This poison is not dangerous, but it gives these critters such a foul taste that they cannot be eaten."
